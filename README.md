Ololos-blog is a travel blog I wrote for learning purposes, now it's mine sort of playground for learning and trying new tech.

If you have any questions about the code and tech, please ask in issues section :) 

The project made of `React`, `next.js`, `apollo-graphql`, `styled-components` and `react-semantic-ui`. 

From next.js part, it uses: 
- Custom express server with custom parameterized routes
- styled-components instead of original styled-jsx
- apollo-grapql integration with next.js
- meta info injection for better CEO
- A few semantic HTML tags so it will be better parsable by bots
- Google analytics integration
